\title{Retrieve significant pairs, based on adjusted p-values.
For each pair that is statistically significant, calculate the
correlation within group1 (e.g. cancer) and the correlation within group2 (e.g.
non-cancer).  Users can then remove pairs with a difference in correlations between
groups 1 and 2 less than a user-defined threshold.}

and associated meta-data}

\item{pvalcutoff}{cutoff of FDR-adjusted p-value for filtering (default 0.05)}

(default bottom 10 percent (high negative coefficients) and top 10 percent 
(high positive coefficients))}

Other options are "stype" and "analyte".}
