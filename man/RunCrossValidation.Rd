\arguments{
\item{inputData}{IntLimData object (output of ReadData()) with analyte levels and
associated meta-data}

\item{folds}{number of folds to create}

\item{analyteType1perc}{percentile cutoff (0-1) for filtering analyte type 1 (e.g. 
remove analytes with mean values < 'analyteType1perc' percentile) (default: 0)}

\item{analyteType2perc}{percentile cutoff (0-1) for filtering analyte type 2 (e.g. 
remove analytes with mean values < 'analyteType2perc' percentile) (default:0)}

\item{analyteMiss}{missing value percent cutoff (0-1) for filtering both analyte types 
(analytes with > X\% missing values will be removed) (default:0)}

\item{cov.cutoff}{percentile cutoff (0-1) for the coefficient of variation of the analytes (default: 0)}

\item{stype}{column name that represents sample type (by default, it will be used
in the interaction term). Only 2 categories or continuous variables are currently supported.}

\item{outcome}{list of outcomes to run. '1' or '2' must be set as outcome/independent variable
(default is '1')}

\item{covar}{Additional variables from the phenotypic data to integrate into linear model}

\item{continuous}{boolean to indicate whether the data is continuous or discrete}

\item{save.covar.pvals}{boolean to indicate whether or not to save the p-values of all covariates,
which can be analyzed later but will also lengthen computation time. The default is FALSE.}

\item{independent.var.type}{list of independent variable types to run. '1' or '2' 
must be set as independent variable
(default is '1')}

\item{remove.duplicates}{boolean to indicate whether or not to remove the 
pair with the highest p-value across two duplicate models (e.g. m1~m2 and m2~m1)}

\item{pvalcutoff}{cutoff of FDR-adjusted p-value for filtering (default 0.05)}

\item{interactionCoeffPercentile}{percentile cutoff for absolute value of coefficient}

\item{rsquaredCutoff}{cutoff for lowest r-squared value}

\item{suppressWarnings}{whether or not to print warnings. If TRUE, do not print.}
