  inputData,
  stype = "",
  outcome = 1,

  continuous = FALSE,
  save.covar.pvals = FALSE,
  independent.var.type = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputData}{IntLimData object (output of ReadData()) with analyte levels
and associated meta-data}

\item{stype}{column name that represents sample type (by default, it will be used
in the interaction term). Only 2 categories and continuous data are currently supported.}

\item{outcome}{'1' or '2' must be set as outcome/independent variable
(default is '1')}

\item{covar}{Additional variables from the phenotypic data that be integrated into linear model}

\item{continuous}{boolean to indicate whether the data is continuous or discrete}

\item{save.covar.pvals}{boolean to indicate whether or not to save the p-values of all covariates,
which can be analyzed later but will also lengthen computation time. The default is FALSE.}

\item{independent.var.type}{'1' or '2' must be set as independent variable
(default is '1')}

\item{remove.duplicates}{boolean to indicate whether or not to remove the 
pair with the highest p-value across two duplicate models (e.g. m1~m2 and m2~m1)}

\item{suppressWarnings}{whether to suppress warnings}
